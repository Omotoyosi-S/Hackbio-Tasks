# Hackbio-Tasks 
This is a 5 week long intensive biocomputing worshkop where we'd be exploring bash scripting basics for bio-data analysis
# Stage zero tasks
This stage involved learning basic bash commands like mkdir for creating new directories, rm for deleting files, **rmdir** for deleting directories, grep for pattern matching and cat for viewing file content. The file HackBioStageZero.sh is the result of this stage.
# Stage one tasks
Stage one involved the usage of bash basics to solve simple bio-data problems. I performed genome sequence analysis using software like fastqc for quality control , fastp for trimming adapter sequences and multiqc for merging quality control reports. All of this was done in the miniconda environment as we were introduced to conda usage. The result of this stage is StageOne.sh
